# Secure Password Reset Flow: A User-Friendly Approach 
 - Welcome to my project! I have developed a secure and user-friendly password reset process that prioritizes user experience without compromising on security.
#  Overview
 ###  Forget Password Page
  - We've designed a dedicated page for password recovery. Users enter their registered email ID.
 ### User Existence Verification
  - The system validates the existence of the user in the database.
  - If the user is not found, an error message is displayed.
 ### OTP Generation and Dispatch
  - A unique One-Time Password (OTP) is generated and dispatched with a password reset link to the user's email.
  - The OTP is securely stored in the database for subsequent verification.
 ### User Verification
  - Upon clicking the link, the system extracts the OTP and validates it against the stored value.
  - If the OTP is valid, the password reset form is displayed. If not, an error message is shown.
 ### Password Reset Form
  - With successful OTP verification, the user accesses a password reset form.
  - Upon submission, the new password is securely stored, and the OTP is cleared from the database.
